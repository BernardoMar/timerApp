# 'Task Tracker App'

##Introduction.

This task tracker app is build on the MERN stack.   

## Technologies:

* MongoDB 

* NodeJS

* Express

* ReactJS

## Functionalities:

Some of the features my pages includes are:

* It allows users to create a new task to track.
* Once the task has been created, they will be displayed in the "Outstanding" table where users can choose to finish the task.
* Once a task has been finished, closed tasks are displayed in a especific table where users can see the duration of the task, start and finish dates. They can also delete the tasks.
* On top of the closed tasks table, users can generate a pdf document with a list of all the tasks that have been finished.
